# Nand2Tetris
This is my personal take on the [nand2tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

This repository is hosted on GitHub for backup purposes, as such it's not well documented nor curated at all.

## Disclaimer
You are free to read through my solutions of the problems, use them and whatever, but they are far from optimized, as I only worked through the minimum viable product, without fancy algorithms. If you did something differently from me, and it still works, don't try to understand my solution since it most likely won't improve yours (and keep in mind that optimization is not needed in this course since after every week you simply switch to pre-implemented chips).

Also, on problem 5's CPU, I shamefully copied [havihva](https://github.com/havivha/Nand2Tetris)'s solution. It was much clearer than mine, and since I think the CPU is one of the chips I'll have to go and check again in the future since it's pretty complex and easy to forget, I prefered having something I could have a glance at and immediately understand it.
