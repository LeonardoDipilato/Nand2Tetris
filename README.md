# Nand2Tetris-Part1
This is my personal take on the [nand2tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

The objective is to learn low-level computer architecture (for personal interest).

## Disclaimer
You are free to read through my solutions of the problems, use them and whatever, but they are far from optimized, as I only worked through the minimum viable product, without fancy algorithms. If you did something differently from me, and it still works, don't try to understand my solution since it most likely won't improve yours (and keep in mind that optimization is not needed in this course since after every week you simply switch to pre-implemented chips).
