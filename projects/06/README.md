# A note about the hackAssembler file
The hackAssembler, apparently, works. However, it differs a little bit both in architecture and in working conditions than what was asked from the course, namely the need to be launched in the same directory as the file you want to assemble.

This is not something I could not remedy in little time, but it'll work as a reminder for me to come back to it later, since I want to make the code of the assembler much clearer and revise it completely. It was written with some hints of a HtDP mindset which wasn't followed as much as it should have been.

My next take on this will be when I have some time to dedicate to it, though it's not an urgency. The update will cover:

- command-line integration
- clean, ready to use documentation
- optimized workflow
